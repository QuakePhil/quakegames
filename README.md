## TODO

How does the below work out in a challenge/accept scenario?

Initial sort of serverlist should be by player's country

When pairing ladder searches, show the server as a dropdown
Everytime a server is chosen, record it
order the dropdown by number of times a server has been chosen
in the future, make this order overrideable by user settings
